<h1 align="center"> 🌿 Urban Greenspaces </h1>

<ul>
<li>Urban Greenspaces is a web-based application that classifies and predicts land cover from satellite imagery across multiple decades (1990, 2000, 2010, etc.). </li>
<li>It simplifies environmental monitoring through ML-driven classification and prediction, making it accessible, accurate, and easy to use.</li></ul>

## 🛰️ Features

- **Land Cover Classification**  
  Detects Dense Vegetation, Sparse Vegetation, Shrubs, Water, and Urban Areas from satellite images.

- **Future Prediction**  
  Uses machine learning models to predict future land cover changes based on historical trends.

- **Change Detection**  
  Identifies environmental shifts such as deforestation and reforestation over time.

- **Seamless Interface**  
  Upload satellite images, visualize classification results in a table, and export data as CSV.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation are slow, manual, and often inaccessible. Existing GIS tools like GEE and ArcGIS are powerful but too complex for non-experts.  
There is no simple tool that allows users to classify and **predict vegetation changes** across decades in a user-friendly web format.

## 🌱 Our Solution

Urban Greenspaces bridges the gap by offering:
- A **simple web interface** for land cover classification and prediction.
- **Machine learning integration** for future land cover forecasting.
- **Decade-wise vegetation analysis** from historical maps.
- Tools for **environmental planning**, **awareness**, and **decision-making**.
